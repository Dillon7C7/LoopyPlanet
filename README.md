# NPower Week 1 Project - The Loopy Planet
This program prints a list of the planets in the solar system,
(excluding Earth), and prompts the user to select a number
that corresponds to a planet via a console-based menu.
 
It then asks a user to input their weight in pounds, and prints out their
weight on the planet that they have chosen.
  
The program will then repeat the process until 
the user enters a number which corresponds to <quit>, which will
cause the process to terminate.
